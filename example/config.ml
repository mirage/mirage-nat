(* we need two network interfaces: a public side and a private side *)
(* a bit of magic: currently, multiple networks only work on Unix and Xen
   backends, so we can get away with this indexes-as-numbers-as-strings
   silliness.
   See https://github.com/mirage/mirage/issues/645 *)

(* finally, use statically configured (at build or runtime) ipv4 addresses.
   (you might want to use dhcp to configure the address on the public interface.
     this is possible, but the code is a bit too convoluted for a good example.
     for now, we'll use statically configured addresses on both interfaces. *)

   modules for each interface. Even though these modules will be the same for
   both interfaces in our case, we have to pass them separately. *)
