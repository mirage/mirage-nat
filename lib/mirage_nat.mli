      on [packet]'s channel according to [mode], and another entry to translate the
      replies back again.

      If [mode] is [`NAT] then the entries will be of the form:

      (packet.src -> packet.dst) becomes (xl_endpoint -> packet.dst)
      (packet.dst -> xl_endpoint) becomes (packet.dst -> packet.src)

      If [mode] is [`Redirect new_dst] then

      (packet.src -> packet.dst) becomes (xl_endpoint -> new_dst)
      (new_dst -> xl_endpoint) becomes (packet.dst -> packet.src)

      In this case, [packet.dst] will typically be an endpoint on the
      NAT itself, to ensure all packets go via the NAT.

      [now] is used to calculate the expiry time for the new entry.

      Returns [`Overlap] if the new entries would partially overlap with an existing
      entry.

      Returns [`Cannot_NAT] if the packet has a non-Global/Organization source or destination,
      or is an ICMP packet which is not a query.
